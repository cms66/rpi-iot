# rpi-iot
The aim of this project is to provide a set of scripts to help with initial setup and security of a Raspberry Pi (using the latest Raspbian image, with a focus on the lite version). After initial setup there is a menu based system for extending capabilities including additional hardware (GPIO hats, camera etc.), network file sharing, image processing and for users with multiple RPi's, it also supports setup of a cluster of RPi's for parallel processing (targeted at home/school use for IoT).

More details about the project and setup instructions are available [here](../../wiki/The-rpi-iot-project)
