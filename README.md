# rpi-iot
The aim of this project is to provide a set of scripts to help with initial setup and security of Raspberry Pi's (using the latest Raspbian image, with the focus on the lite version). As well as extending capabilities for additional hardware (GPIO hats, camera etc.). For users with multiple RPi's, it also supports setup of a cluster of RPi's for parallel processing (targeted at home/school use for IoT).

An overview of the project and setup instructions are available at
