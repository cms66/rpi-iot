# rpi-iot
The aim of this project is to provide a set of scripts to help with initial setup and security of Raspberry Pi's (using Raspbian image), as well as extending capabilities for additional hardware (GPIO hats, camera etc.). For users with multiple RPi's, it will also support setup of a cluster for parallel processing (targeted at home/school use for IoT).
